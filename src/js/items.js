Have a great day and I deeply and sincerely appreciate your order and hope that if you love it you will give me feedback on etsy as it&#39;s really important to me and my work. And if you are unhappy for any reason you contact me directly and I will try my hardest to resolve it. Thank u again. I love leather. I love how it smells, how it feels in my hand, how the thread goes through the needle, and how the needle punctures the leather. My work relationship with leather started accidentally when someone sold me a box of leather remnants in a flea market in 1998 for 20 dollars. I brought it home and made miniature purses and boots out of it, sewing and gluing them onto cards. From the cards I went on to make leather journals and from there, the satchels, the bags, and the belts. The elation it brought me made me quit my job as a school director and pursue &quot;leather&quot; full time. Infatuation with leather did not start there. My first real leather belt came from and NYU craft show, where the leather smith made me a custom belt. The rhythmic pounding of his hammer on his wooden table created music through the leaves and the trees. The breeze... shook me, the power of creation had echoed in me. I wore the belt almost every day, hearing the echo, for 10 years. Of the few things that made it back home after two and half years were my first real leather shoes, which I wore in the heat of summer and the dead of winter. The more I walked in them the better they felt. The belt and shoes are long gone, they were stolen out of my car in a parking garage in N.Y.C., but the feeling of good strong quality leather, as something that grows with you, stays with me. This and other memories came to me as I cut my first bag, sewed my first pieces, without any schooling or training in leather, just hearing the echo. Creating a multidimensional functional piece with pockets, closures, hidden compartments, secret places out of something flat and languid makes me smile, and gives me a high every single time. Leather is my calling. DEAR INTERNATINAL BUYERS On January 27th the shipping to International countried greatly increased almost 10 dollars for every flat rate package.

How does cocoa paper help cocoa farmers? Cocoa farmers benefit directly by receiving higher incomes from their cocoa farm as they sell the bark stripped from cocoa tree branches removed in the necessary pruning process. We also train cocoa farmers how to prune effectively to maximize production efficiency. For those farmers who had previously not pruned their trees diligently, the impact of being trained and motivated to prune their trees can be a very significant increase in farm income up to 40% due to cocoa productivity increases. 2. How much are cocoa farmers paid for the bark used to make cocoa paper? Cocoa farmers receive Rp1200 (about USD13c) per kilogram of freshly harvested wet bark, which is equivalent to Rp2400 (about 26c) per kilogram dry. This is approximately 10% of the value of 1 kilogram of dried cocoa beans and more than the current premium being paid for fermented verses unfermented cocoa. This makes the sale of cocoa bark quite attractive to cocoa farmers but not so high that it would cause farmers to cut down their trees or prune excessively to produce more bark. 3. How much cocoa bark goes into cocoa paper? Cocoa paper typically contains 60% cocoa fiber and 40% recycled office paper waste. However the cocoa bark contains between 15%-20% fibre and this means that we need 3kg of fresh cocoa bark or 1.5kg of dried cocoa bark to produce 1kg of cocoa paper. The waste non-fibre bark material produced in the process is composted and returned to the soil as it is quite high in important nutrients particularly Potassium and Phosphorous, which are required by the cocoa trees to produce the cocoa fruit. 4. What happens to the waste that you produce in the cocoa paper making process? As we strive to produce truly sustainable products that add value to existing waste streams or improve the utilization of materials or skills to improve the lives of people in developing communities, we pay very close attention to the way in which our products are produced and the waste streams from those processes. The cocoa paper process avoids the use of harsh bleaches and chemicals to reduce the environmental impact and make the final waste processing more simple and effective. Solid waste in all areas of the process from fibre extraction to the finished products are either recycled or composted. Liquid waste produced in the traditional paper making process are minimized by recycling and finally treated in living ponds to meet accepted standards prior to disposal. 5. Is cocoa paper safe for dogs? Cocoa paper is handmade using traditional paper making processes and not meant for consumption. While many cocoa and chocolate products contain theobromine, which can be of concern for dogs and other animals, the very small levels that may naturally occur in the cocoa bark will be largely removed in the paper making process. Any residual theobromine in cocoa paper would therefore be extremely low and is unlikely to be of any concern unless quite a large amount were consumed. If your dog has consumed any significant quantity of cocoa paper or displays any signs of distress after consuming cocoa paper it would be advisable to consult a veterinarian. 6. How is handmade paper different from mill-made paper? Paper used in offices and homes is usually mill made from wood pulp obtained by cutting down trees and by adding heaving chemicals and dyes. Which are very harmful for our environment. In making handmade paper, there are no added chemicals and harmful dyes used. Our paper is made using natural cocoa tree bark and recycled white office paper. Using handmade paper saves our environment and helps the communities involved in our supply chain, paper making and stationery production. ",

policy_welcome: "Now offering free shipping on all items within the United States! Thanks so much for stopping by my etsy shop! Almost all items are available to be customized, you can convo me anytime for more details! A few things to keep in mind... Leather is natural! Colors vary from hide to hide, and our leather is top grain, distress leather. Scratches, different tones, and different shades of our basic colors show up on each hide that we get. We believe it makes each piece unique and special. Free Customization: I use stamps and stencils to print on these with an ink that is specific to leather, and we have 3000+ images/stamps that are available to use for no extra charge! Stuff that costs more: Recreating images sent to us is not part of our normal process. In order to recreate an image, we would need to have a stamp custom made, or cut a stencil of the image. Cutting a stencil is a variable cost, please contact us for more details. If you would like more pricing information about having a stamp made from your image, please convo us. The BASE price for having a stamp made is $30 (plus the cost of the item you wanted to have stamped) and the turn around time on a custom stamp takes an average of two weeks. Remember that you can always choose from our thousands of available images for no extra charge, and we are more than happy to help guide you through designing your own personalized journal using our available options for no extra charge. Adding text? Read this: We can add up to 10 words to most items (size permitting) for no extra charge. Our flasks and small wallets are an exception to this rule, many of these items will not fit 10 words.

",
policy_additional: "Thanks so much for stopping by my etsy shop! Almost all items are available to be customized, you can convo me anytime for more details! A few things to keep in mind... Leather is natural! Colors vary from hide to hide, and our leather is top grain, distress leather. Scratches, different tones, and different shades of our basic colors show up on each hide that we get. We believe it makes each piece unique and special. Free Customization: I use stamps and stencils to print on these with an ink that is specific to leather, and we have 3000+ images/stamps that are available to use for no extra charge! Stuff that costs more: Recreating images sent to us is not part of our normal process. In order to recreate an image, we would need to have a stamp custom made, or cut a stencil of the image. Cutting a stencil is a variable cost, please contact us for more details. If you would like more pricing information about having a stamp made from your image, please convo us. The BASE price for having a stamp made is $30 (plus the cost of the item you wanted to have stamped) and the turn around time on a custom stamp takes an average of two weeks. Remember that you can always choose from our thousands of available images for no extra charge, and we are more than happy to help guide you through designing your own personalized journal using our available options for no extra charge. Adding text? Read this: We can add up to 10 words to most items (size permitting) for no extra charge. Our flasks and small wallets are an exception to this rule, many of these items will not fit 10 words. Please understand that while we can occasionally add more than 10 words for an extra charge to our journals and large wallets for an extra cost, we do have space constraints, and on no occasion can we add more than 15-20 words. Please convo us for pricing information for text that exceeds our 10 word limit, so we can get you more pricing information. We do have one font and font size, it is the american typewriter font shown in the shop, each letter is about .75 cm high/wide, and is handstamped individually (some variation may occur because of the handstamping process).

Placement of text 3. Exact image you would like 4. Placement of image We also offer 3 different colors of leather for our journals and wallets: Taupe, Gold, and Brandy. We offer several options for our flasks, all seen in the drop down color menu of the item.

Thank you for contacting In Blue :) We are traveling this week to Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, then to Floyd Fest in Virginia, and Newport Folk Fest in Rhode Island starting July 14th. We will be accepting orders again starting Wednesday, July 23rd. Our shipping schedule will not resume until Tuesday, July 29th. We would love to give you a hand with the ordering process and will be checking email periodically. Please understand that no rush orders can be fulfilled during this time because of our absence - there is simply no one in the studio to make the item this week. We promise to hurry back! Because of the nature of our vending schedule at these amazing events, we will do our best to get back to everyone within one day of email, but there are always a few computer/wi-fi hiccups and delays when we are on the road. In the meantime, check out www.100proofpress.com for all of our available stamps, and their dimensions. We can order anything off of that site for no extra charge. Even though we are in autoresponse mode we can see your email and can put a stamp in our order queue to avoid further delays - let us know which you love! Thank you so much, we are so excited to be included in Pitchfork, Floyd Fest, and Newport Folk Fest this year, and we are so excited to hear from you!

title: "Book Safe - The Wizard of Oz - Yellow Leather Bound Hollow Book Safe",
description: "Book Safe – The Wizard of Oz - Leather Bound Book/Safe Specifications: Title: The Wizard of Oz, First Five Novels (Made from a new book) Size (Outer book): 6-1/2&quot; x 9-3/8&quot; x 1-3/4&quot; Approximately (Wide, Tall, Thick) Cover - Hardback, Bonded Leather Bound. Inside Compartment Dimensions: 4-1/4&quot; x 7-5/8&quot; x 1-5/8&quot; (Wide, Tall, Deep) Features Specific to this Book Safe: Painted and Embossed Encyclopedia Style Spine and Cover Book safes are an age old way to stash one’s treasures–the key to a safe, a private document, a flask, cash, jewelry and of course… secret love letters. And you can use them while traveling to hide your ipod, back up cash, or other valuables from would-be thieves. And of course if you end up wrongfully imprisoned, they work as an excellent place to stash a rock hammer for tunneling your way to freedom. Not only are book safes fun to possess, they also make a cool, unique gift. First some considerations when looking for a book safe. The whole point is to conceal something from prying eyes, so be careful what book safe you choose. You don’t want it to stand out in your book case. If this is for yourself, choose a book that will fit in on your shelf. If you’ve got a shelf full of new mystery paperbacks, a large vintage medical textbook will look suspicious and out of place. Additionally, consider picking a book that people aren’t likely to pull off your shelf out of curiosity. Think “The Economic History of Kazakhstan” instead of “The Secrets of Better Sex”. But if you’re giving the book safe as a gift, choose a volume that suits the personality and interests of the intended recipient. For Whom the Bell Tolls for Dad; Nancy Drew for little sis. Now about my book safes, what makes them different? Usually I only use upcycled used books, not new. This allows the wear and tear of a book add to the charm of your safe while lending a bit of charm to your collection. Besides, cutting up a new, unread book defeats the original purpose of that literary masterpiece. Think of it as a second life for a book that has been enjoyed. Unlike many home crafted book safes, I have added a few construction design upgrades of my own. Learning from my woodworking experience I experimented and came up with the following improvements. (Technically, a book is “wood” so this is not too much of a departure from what I usually craft. #1 – These safes have been crafted with “natural” page edges. Meaning that I do not just coat the outer, exposed page edges with a layer of glue. My safes actually appear to be an unaltered book when closed. You can actually thumb the pages and they separate along the edge, just like a regular book. #2 – Internal reinforcements. In larger, thicker books, I have found a way to insert metal pins that keep the book safe square and ridged. These metal pins are totally concealed. Some other book safes tend to “droop” since so much of the internal page material removed to create the cavity. Note: Any props in the pictures are NOT INCLUDED. Electronics, cash, jewelry and other items are used to demonstrate scale of the book and compartment. Shipping: Now offering International Shipping for this item!! Shipments within the USA are sent via 1st Class Mail, Parcel Post or Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. International Shipments are sent by International First Class Parcel Post or Flat Rate Priority. Please note however – For your protection please provide a “secure” delivery address. Packages left at your door by the carrier are considered “Delivered”, even if your neighborhood kids get to it before you. I cannot be responsible for the item once it leaves my possession. See my shop policies for further details. CA buyers, sales tax will be added to your order. Feedback: Once you leave feedback for me I will reciprocate. That’s only fair.",

Once payment has been received I will ship your item right away. Payments not received within 24 hours, unless arrangements are made, will result in a cancellation of the sale.",
policy_shipping: "Shipping Policy First and foremost you must provide a “Secure” delivery address. Packages left at your door or in your mailbox are considered “Delivered”. Even if your neighborhood kids get to the package before you. I can not be responsible for your item once it shows as &quot;Delivered&quot; by the carrier. (However, carriers can make mistakes and I know this, so any issues will be handled on a case by case basis). It is also the responsibility of the buyer to provide an accurate and complete shipping address. Order and Shipping charges will not be refunded for packages sent to a customer provided address that is incorrect. Reshipments to a corrected address will be at the customer’s expense. Shipping Time – I can usually ship your purchase by the next business day. However, there will be occasions when I am not available due to business travel or vacation. In these situations I will make every effort to contact you with an estimated shipping time. (Also, I make it a point to update the shop announcements if I will be away.) USA Shipping – I usually ship via First Class Package with Delivery Confirmation 13 ounces and under. Priority with Delivery Confirmation on everything over 13 ounces and on most combined purchases. Whenever possible I will use a flat rate box. On a rare occasion I reserve the right to use UPS or FedEx when appropriate. However, I reserve the option to choose the shipping method that is most economical. (See Shipping Overcharge Refund below) International Shipping – I use First Class International on anything under 13 ounces. Over 13 ounces I use Priority International. I will use flat rate international for any large orders so please contact me before you purchase for an exact shipping price. International customers are responsible for all customs, VAT or duty charges. All knowledge of what is permitted for shipping to the destination country is the responsibility of the buyer. I will not be responsible for confiscated or “lost” items once they are in the postal system, a refund will not be issued. Shipping Overcharges Refund – I will always extend a refund for significant shipping overcharges, minus any fees paid. Refunds will come in the form of cash in the box with your item, or a refund back to your PayPal account or Etsy Direct Checkout transaction. For multiple item purchases I use Flat Rate Boxes when economically beneficial so shipping costs can be quite a bit less than what is calculated during checkout. If requested, I can quote shipping prior to your purchase. The checkout process may change in this scenario so that I can generate a corrected sale invoice. Gift Shipping – I will be happy to ship your purchase as a gift to the person of your choice. Contact me with any special request. Notes on Transit Times: Depending on what service was used to mail your item and what country you are in, delivery times can vary. With your shipping notification you should receive your tracking information for the shipment. Depending on how you paid, you may receive more than one shipping notification. (Example, one from Etsy and another from PayPal) Please note that tracking information is updated nightly with the USPS and may not be “up to the minute” during the day. If your item was shipped to a US address: (The closer you are to CA the faster it will be) Via Priority Mail – Typically delivery will occur within 2-4 business days once the post office accepts the package. First Class Parcel – Typically delivery will occur within 3-7 business days once the post office accepts the package. Parcel Post - Typically delivery will occur within 3-12 business days once the post office accepts the package. International orders take longer. Most countries will deliver the item within two week but sometimes it has been known to take eight weeks or longer. (This is a rare occurrence) If you are worried and wish to track your order, depending on the country you live in, you can use the customs form tracking number to locate the package in your countries customs clearing service or postal service provider. ",
policy_refunds: "Delivery Confirmation is there for our protection, both yours and mine. If an item is lost in the mail and can not be recovered within the carrier&#39;s specified &quot;investigation&quot; timeline I will of course offer a refund or reship a new item. High value items damaged in shipment will be refunded once I get the settlement from the carrier(when applicable) and where the buyer provides proof of the damage. I may ask that the item be returned at my expense for inspection or that the buyer provide pictures of the damaged item. However, a lot of international shipments are not insurable with any reliability, buyer assumes this risk. Otherwise I can&#39;t be responsible for product once it leaves my care and has been marked &quot;delivered&quot; buy the carrier. Returns: I will work with anyone with a reasonable request as long as the items are in new, unused, and resalable condition with all original parts, accessories and documentation. Requests for return must be made within 5 days of delivery. Returns for any reason other than damage will be at the expense of the buyer. The original shipping and any unrecoverable transaction fees will not be refunded.",
policy_additional: "I can handle wholesale requests on certain items made in my shop. Contact me with inquiries. I will entertain custom orders so feel free to contact me. I do customer work all the time. Q: Can you make a particular book thicker, thinner, wider or bigger? A: No, all of my creations are made from REAL BOOKS. I have no control over how a publisher decides to manufacture any individual book. Q: Can you create special cover artwork or title. A: No, these are made from real books converted through my process. The outside of the book is 100% original to the converted book. Q: Can you do a custom cutout, like a heart? A: Yes, I can do a custom cut out as long as I’m starting with an unaltered book, meaning that the cutout has not already been done. Contact me for any custom work and we can discuss details, option and limitations. Q: What it the thickest book available? A: I can cut books up to 2” thick. Any thicker and it will not fit under my saw for the cutting process. Q: Can I send you a book to hollow out? A: In most cases yes. Contact me for any custom work and we can discuss details, option and limitations. Q: Can you install magnetic enclosures or a lock? A: At this time, no. For a number of structural, appearance and durability reasons I don’t offer this service. Contact me for details if you would like to know more. ",

description: "Book Safe – Abraham Lincoln - Leather Bound Book/Safe Specifications: Title: Abraham Lincoln, Selected Writings (Made from a new book) Size (Outer book): 6-3/8&quot; x 9-1/2&quot; x 1-5/8&quot; Approximately (Wide, Tall, Thick) Cover - Hardback, Leather Bound. Inside Compartment Dimensions: 4-1/4&quot; x 7-5/8&quot; x 1-3/8&quot; (Wide, Tall, Deep) Features Specific to this Book Safe: Painted and Embossed Encyclopedia Style Spine and Cover Book safes are an age old way to stash one’s treasures–the key to a safe, a private document, a flask, cash, jewelry and of course… secret love letters. And you can use them while traveling to hide your ipod, back up cash, or other valuables from would-be thieves. And of course if you end up wrongfully imprisoned, they work as an excellent place to stash a rock hammer for tunneling your way to freedom. Not only are book safes fun to possess, they also make a cool, unique gift. First some considerations when looking for a book safe. The whole point is to conceal something from prying eyes, so be careful what book safe you choose. You don’t want it to stand out in your book case. If this is for yourself, choose a book that will fit in on your shelf. If you’ve got a shelf full of new mystery paperbacks, a large vintage medical textbook will look suspicious and out of place. Additionally, consider picking a book that people aren’t likely to pull off your shelf out of curiosity. Think “The Economic History of Kazakhstan” instead of “The Secrets of Better Sex”. But if you’re giving the book safe as a gift, choose a volume that suits the personality and interests of the intended recipient. For Whom the Bell Tolls for Dad; Nancy Drew for little sis. Now about my book safes, what makes them different? Usually I use upcycled used books, not new. This allows the wear and tear of a book add to the charm of your safe while lending a bit of charm to your collection. Besides, cutting up a new, unread book defeats the original purpose of that literary masterpiece. Think of it as a second life for a book that has been enjoyed. Unlike many home crafted book safes, I have added a few construction design upgrades of my own. Learning from my woodworking experience I experimented and came up with the following improvements. (Technically, a book is “wood” so this is not too much of a departure from what I usually craft. #1 – These safes have been crafted with “natural” page edges. Meaning that I do not just coat the outer, exposed page edges with a layer of glue. My safes actually appear to be an unaltered book when closed. You can actually thumb the pages and they separate along the edge, just like a regular book. #2 – Internal reinforcements. In larger, thicker books, I have found a way to insert metal pins that keep the book safe square and ridged. These metal pins are totally concealed. Some other book safes tend to “droop” since so much of the internal page material removed to create the cavity. Note: Any props in the pictures are NOT INCLUDED. Electronics, cash, jewelry and other items are used to demonstrate scale of the book and compartment. Shipping: Now offering International Shipping for this item!! Shipments within the USA are sent via 1st Class Mail, Parcel Post or Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. International Shipments are sent by International First Class Parcel Post or Flat Rate Priority. Please note however – For your protection please provide a “secure” delivery address. Packages left at your door by the carrier are considered “Delivered”, even if your neighborhood kids get to it before you. I cannot be responsible for the item once it leaves my possession. See my shop policies for further details. CA buyers, sales tax will be added to your order. Feedback: Once you leave feedback for me I will reciprocate. That’s only fair.",

policy_welcome: "My creations are born of my love for working with wood. I enjoy working with solid wood and veneers but always in a manner that produces a quality product. But of course, books are wood too!",
policy_payment: "Sales Tax is applied to all CA orders. If you purchased the item I know that you would like to start enjoying it right away. Prompt payment will help to ensure this. Once payment has been received I will ship your item right away. Payments not received within 24 hours, unless arrangements are made, will result in a cancellation of the sale.",
policy_shipping: "Shipping Policy First and foremost you must provide a “Secure” delivery address. Packages left at your door or in your mailbox are considered “Delivered”. Even if your neighborhood kids get to the package before you. I can not be responsible for your item once it shows as &quot;Delivered&quot; by the carrier. (However, carriers can make mistakes and I know this, so any issues will be handled on a case by case basis). It is also the responsibility of the buyer to provide an accurate and complete shipping address. Order and Shipping charges will not be refunded for packages sent to a customer provided address that is incorrect. Reshipments to a corrected address will be at the customer’s expense. Shipping Time – I can usually ship your purchase by the next business day. However, there will be occasions when I am not available due to business travel or vacation. In these situations I will make every effort to contact you with an estimated shipping time. (Also, I make it a point to update the shop announcements if I will be away.) USA Shipping – I usually ship via First Class Package with Delivery Confirmation 13 ounces and under. Priority with Delivery Confirmation on everything over 13 ounces and on most combined purchases. Whenever possible I will use a flat rate box. On a rare occasion I reserve the right to use UPS or FedEx when appropriate. However, I reserve the option to choose the shipping method that is most economical. (See Shipping Overcharge Refund below) International Shipping – I use First Class International on anything under 13 ounces. Over 13 ounces I use Priority International. I will use flat rate international for any large orders so please contact me before you purchase for an exact shipping price. International customers are responsible for all customs, VAT or duty charges. All knowledge of what is permitted for shipping to the destination country is the responsibility of the buyer. I will not be responsible for confiscated or “lost” items once they are in the postal system, a refund will not be issued. Shipping Overcharges Refund – I will always extend a refund for significant shipping overcharges, minus any fees paid. Refunds will come in the form of cash in the box with your item, or a refund back to your PayPal account or Etsy Direct Checkout transaction. For multiple item purchases I use Flat Rate Boxes when economically beneficial so shipping costs can be quite a bit less than what is calculated during checkout. If requested, I can quote shipping prior to your purchase. The checkout process may change in this scenario so that I can generate a corrected sale invoice. Gift Shipping – I will be happy to ship your purchase as a gift to the person of your choice. Contact me with any special request. Notes on Transit Times: Depending on what service was used to mail your item and what country you are in, delivery times can vary. With your shipping notification you should receive your tracking information for the shipment. Depending on how you paid, you may receive more than one shipping notification. (Example, one from Etsy and another from PayPal) Please note that tracking information is updated nightly with the USPS and may not be “up to the minute” during the day. If your item was shipped to a US address: (The closer you are to CA the faster it will be) Via Priority Mail – Typically delivery will occur within 2-4 business days once the post office accepts the package. First Class Parcel – Typically delivery will occur within 3-7 business days once the post office accepts the package. Parcel Post - Typically delivery will occur within 3-12 business days once the post office accepts the package. International orders take longer. Most countries will deliver the item within two week but sometimes it has been known to take eight weeks or longer. (This is a rare occurrence) If you are worried and wish to track your order, depending on the country you live in, you can use the customs form tracking number to locate the package in your countries customs clearing service or postal service provider. ",
policy_refunds: "Delivery Confirmation is there for our protection, both yours and mine. If an item is lost in the mail and can not be recovered within the carrier&#39;s specified &quot;investigation&quot; timeline I will of course offer a refund or reship a new item. High value items damaged in shipment will be refunded once I get the settlement from the carrier(when applicable) and where the buyer provides proof of the damage. I may ask that the item be returned at my expense for inspection or that the buyer provide pictures of the damaged item. However, a lot of international shipments are not insurable with any reliability, buyer assumes this risk. Otherwise I can&#39;t be responsible for product once it leaves my care and has been marked &quot;delivered&quot; buy the carrier. Returns: I will work with anyone with a reasonable request as long as the items are in new, unused, and resalable condition with all original parts, accessories and documentation. Requests for return must be made within 5 days of delivery. Returns for any reason other than damage will be at the expense of the buyer. The original shipping and any unrecoverable transaction fees will not be refunded.",
policy_additional: "I can handle wholesale requests on certain items made in my shop. Contact me with inquiries. I will entertain custom orders so feel free to contact me. I do customer work all the time. Q: Can you make a particular book thicker, thinner, wider or bigger? A: No, all of my creations are made from REAL BOOKS. I have no control over how a publisher decides to manufacture any individual book. Q: Can you create special cover artwork or title. A: No, these are made from real books converted through my process. The outside of the book is 100% original to the converted book. Q: Can you do a custom cutout, like a heart? A: Yes, I can do a custom cut out as long as I’m starting with an unaltered book, meaning that the cutout has not already been done. Contact me for any custom work and we can discuss details, option and limitations. Q: What it the thickest book available? A: I can cut books up to 2” thick. Any thicker and it will not fit under my saw for the cutting process. Q: Can I send you a book to hollow out? A: In most cases yes. Contact me for any custom work and we can discuss details, option and limitations. Q: Can you install magnetic enclosures or a lock? A: At this time, no. For a number of structural, appearance and durability reasons I don’t offer this service. Contact me for details if you would like to know more. ",

policy_payment: "Sales Tax is applied to all CA orders. If you purchased the item I know that you would like to start enjoying it right away. Prompt payment will help to ensure this. Once payment has been received I will ship your item right away. Payments not received within 24 hours, unless arrangements are made, will result in a cancellation of the sale.",
policy_shipping: "Shipping Policy First and foremost you must provide a “Secure” delivery address. Packages left at your door or in your mailbox are considered “Delivered”. Even if your neighborhood kids get to the package before you. I can not be responsible for your item once it shows as &quot;Delivered&quot; by the carrier. (However, carriers can make mistakes and I know this, so any issues will be handled on a case by case basis). It is also the responsibility of the buyer to provide an accurate and complete shipping address. Order and Shipping charges will not be refunded for packages sent to a customer provided address that is incorrect. Reshipments to a corrected address will be at the customer’s expense. Shipping Time – I can usually ship your purchase by the next business day. However, there will be occasions when I am not available due to business travel or vacation. In these situations I will make every effort to contact you with an estimated shipping time. (Also, I make it a point to update the shop announcements if I will be away.) USA Shipping – I usually ship via First Class Package with Delivery Confirmation 13 ounces and under. Priority with Delivery Confirmation on everything over 13 ounces and on most combined purchases. Whenever possible I will use a flat rate box. On a rare occasion I reserve the right to use UPS or FedEx when appropriate. However, I reserve the option to choose the shipping method that is most economical. (See Shipping Overcharge Refund below) International Shipping – I use First Class International on anything under 13 ounces. Over 13 ounces I use Priority International. I will use flat rate international for any large orders so please contact me before you purchase for an exact shipping price. International customers are responsible for all customs, VAT or duty charges. All knowledge of what is permitted for shipping to the destination country is the responsibility of the buyer. I will not be responsible for confiscated or “lost” items once they are in the postal system, a refund will not be issued. Shipping Overcharges Refund – I will always extend a refund for significant shipping overcharges, minus any fees paid. Refunds will come in the form of cash in the box with your item, or a refund back to your PayPal account or Etsy Direct Checkout transaction. For multiple item purchases I use Flat Rate Boxes when economically beneficial so shipping costs can be quite a bit less than what is calculated during checkout. If requested, I can quote shipping prior to your purchase. The checkout process may change in this scenario so that I can generate a corrected sale invoice. Gift Shipping – I will be happy to ship your purchase as a gift to the person of your choice. Contact me with any special request. Notes on Transit Times: Depending on what service was used to mail your item and what country you are in, delivery times can vary. With your shipping notification you should receive your tracking information for the shipment. Depending on how you paid, you may receive more than one shipping notification. (Example, one from Etsy and another from PayPal) Please note that tracking information is updated nightly with the USPS and may not be “up to the minute” during the day. If your item was shipped to a US address: (The closer you are to CA the faster it will be) Via Priority Mail – Typically delivery will occur within 2-4 business days once the post office accepts the package. First Class Parcel – Typically delivery will occur within 3-7 business days once the post office accepts the package. Parcel Post - Typically delivery will occur within 3-12 business days once the post office accepts the package. International orders take longer. Most countries will deliver the item within two week but sometimes it has been known to take eight weeks or longer. (This is a rare occurrence) If you are worried and wish to track your order, depending on the country you live in, you can use the customs form tracking number to locate the package in your countries customs clearing service or postal service provider. ",
policy_refunds: "Delivery Confirmation is there for our protection, both yours and mine. If an item is lost in the mail and can not be recovered within the carrier&#39;s specified &quot;investigation&quot; timeline I will of course offer a refund or reship a new item. High value items damaged in shipment will be refunded once I get the settlement from the carrier(when applicable) and where the buyer provides proof of the damage. I may ask that the item be returned at my expense for inspection or that the buyer provide pictures of the damaged item. However, a lot of international shipments are not insurable with any reliability, buyer assumes this risk. Otherwise I can&#39;t be responsible for product once it leaves my care and has been marked &quot;delivered&quot; buy the carrier. Returns: I will work with anyone with a reasonable request as long as the items are in new, unused, and resalable condition with all original parts, accessories and documentation. Requests for return must be made within 5 days of delivery. Returns for any reason other than damage will be at the expense of the buyer. The original shipping and any unrecoverable transaction fees will not be refunded.",
policy_additional: "I can handle wholesale requests on certain items made in my shop. Contact me with inquiries. I will entertain custom orders so feel free to contact me. I do customer work all the time. Q: Can you make a particular book thicker, thinner, wider or bigger? A: No, all of my creations are made from REAL BOOKS. I have no control over how a publisher decides to manufacture any individual book. Q: Can you create special cover artwork or title. A: No, these are made from real books converted through my process. The outside of the book is 100% original to the converted book. Q: Can you do a custom cutout, like a heart? A: Yes, I can do a custom cut out as long as I’m starting with an unaltered book, meaning that the cutout has not already been done. Contact me for any custom work and we can discuss details, option and limitations. Q: What it the thickest book available? A: I can cut books up to 2” thick. Any thicker and it will not fit under my saw for the cutting process. Q: Can I send you a book to hollow out? A: In most cases yes. Contact me for any custom work and we can discuss details, option and limitations. Q: Can you install magnetic enclosures or a lock? A: At this time, no. For a number of structural, appearance and durability reasons I don’t offer this service. Contact me for details if you would like to know more. ",

title: "Hollow Book Safe - The Star Wars Trilogy - C3PO Leather Bound",
description: "Book Safe – The Star Wars Trilogy - Leather Bound Book/Safe Specifications: Title: The Star Wars Trilogy (Made from a new book) Size (Outer book): 6-3/8&quot; x 9-3/8&quot; x 1-3/4&quot; Approximately (Wide, Tall, Thick) Cover - Hardback, Leather Bound. Inside Compartment Dimensions: 4-3/8&quot; x 7-5/8&quot; x 1-1/2&quot; (Wide, Tall, Deep) Features Specific to this Book Safe: Painted and Embossed Encyclopedia Style Spine and Cover Book safes are an age old way to stash one’s treasures–the key to a safe, a private document, a flask, cash, jewelry and of course… secret love letters. And you can use them while traveling to hide your ipod, back up cash, or other valuables from would-be thieves. And of course if you end up wrongfully imprisoned, they work as an excellent place to stash a rock hammer for tunneling your way to freedom. Not only are book safes fun to possess, they also make a cool, unique gift. First some considerations when looking for a book safe. The whole point is to conceal something from prying eyes, so be careful what book safe you choose. You don’t want it to stand out in your book case. If this is for yourself, choose a book that will fit in on your shelf. If you’ve got a shelf full of new mystery paperbacks, a large vintage medical textbook will look suspicious and out of place. Additionally, consider picking a book that people aren’t likely to pull off your shelf out of curiosity. Think “The Economic History of Kazakhstan” instead of “The Secrets of Better Sex”. But if you’re giving the book safe as a gift, choose a volume that suits the personality and interests of the intended recipient. For Whom the Bell Tolls for Dad; Nancy Drew for little sis. Now about my book safes, what makes them different? Usually I use upcycled used books, not new. This allows the wear and tear of a book add to the charm of your safe while lending a bit of charm to your collection. Besides, cutting up a new, unread book defeats the original purpose of that literary masterpiece. Think of it as a second life for a book that has been enjoyed. Unlike many home crafted book safes, I have added a few construction design upgrades of my own. Learning from my woodworking experience I experimented and came up with the following improvements. (Technically, a book is “wood” so this is not too much of a departure from what I usually craft. #1 – These safes have been crafted with “natural” page edges. Meaning that I do not just coat the outer, exposed page edges with a layer of glue. My safes actually appear to be an unaltered book when closed. You can actually thumb the pages and they separate along the edge, just like a regular book. #2 – Internal reinforcements. In larger, thicker books, I have found a way to insert metal pins that keep the book safe square and ridged. These metal pins are totally concealed. Some other book safes tend to “droop” since so much of the internal page material removed to create the cavity. Note: Any props in the pictures are NOT INCLUDED. Electronics, cash, jewelry and other items are used to demonstrate scale of the book and compartment. Shipping: Now offering International Shipping for this item!! Shipments within the USA are sent via 1st Class Mail, Parcel Post or Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. International Shipments are sent by International First Class Parcel Post or Flat Rate Priority. Please note however – For your protection please provide a “secure” delivery address. Packages left at your door by the carrier are considered “Delivered”, even if your neighborhood kids get to it before you. I cannot be responsible for the item once it leaves my possession. See my shop policies for further details. CA buyers, sales tax will be added to your order. Feedback: Once you leave feedback for me I will reciprocate. That’s only fair.",

title: "Hollow Book Safe - Nikola Tesla - Leather Bound",
description: "Book Safe – Nikola Tesla - Leather Bound Book/Safe Specifications: Title: The Inventions, Research and Writings of Nikola Tesla (Made from a new book) Size (Outer book): 6-3/8&quot; x 9-1/2&quot; x 1-1/2&quot; Approximately (Wide, Tall, Thick) Cover - Hardback, Leather Bound. Inside Compartment Dimensions: 4-1/4&quot; x 7-5/8&quot; x 1-1/4&quot; (Wide, Tall, Deep) Features Specific to this Book Safe: Painted and Embossed Encyclopedia Style Spine and Cover Book safes are an age old way to stash one’s treasures–the key to a safe, a private document, a flask, cash, jewelry and of course… secret love letters. And you can use them while traveling to hide your ipod, back up cash, or other valuables from would-be thieves. And of course if you end up wrongfully imprisoned, they work as an excellent place to stash a rock hammer for tunneling your way to freedom. Not only are book safes fun to possess, they also make a cool, unique gift. First some considerations when looking for a book safe. The whole point is to conceal something from prying eyes, so be careful what book safe you choose. You don’t want it to stand out in your book case. If this is for yourself, choose a book that will fit in on your shelf. If you’ve got a shelf full of new mystery paperbacks, a large vintage medical textbook will look suspicious and out of place. Additionally, consider picking a book that people aren’t likely to pull off your shelf out of curiosity. Think “The Economic History of Kazakhstan” instead of “The Secrets of Better Sex”. But if you’re giving the book safe as a gift, choose a volume that suits the personality and interests of the intended recipient. For Whom the Bell Tolls for Dad; Nancy Drew for little sis. Now about my book safes, what makes them different? Usually I use upcycled used books, not new. This allows the wear and tear of a book add to the charm of your safe while lending a bit of charm to your collection. Besides, cutting up a new, unread book defeats the original purpose of that literary masterpiece. Think of it as a second life for a book that has been enjoyed. Unlike many home crafted book safes, I have added a few construction design upgrades of my own. Learning from my woodworking experience I experimented and came up with the following improvements. (Technically, a book is “wood” so this is not too much of a departure from what I usually craft. #1 – These safes have been crafted with “natural” page edges. Meaning that I do not just coat the outer, exposed page edges with a layer of glue. My safes actually appear to be an unaltered book when closed. You can actually thumb the pages and they separate along the edge, just like a regular book. #2 – Internal reinforcements. In larger, thicker books, I have found a way to insert metal pins that keep the book safe square and ridged. These metal pins are totally concealed. Some other book safes tend to “droop” since so much of the internal page material removed to create the cavity. Note: Any props in the pictures are NOT INCLUDED. Electronics, cash, jewelry and other items are used to demonstrate scale of the book and compartment. Shipping: Now offering International Shipping for this item!! Shipments within the USA are sent via 1st Class Mail, Parcel Post or Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. International Shipments are sent by International First Class Parcel Post or Flat Rate Priority. Please note however – For your protection please provide a “secure” delivery address. Packages left at your door by the carrier are considered “Delivered”, even if your neighborhood kids get to it before you. I cannot be responsible for the item once it leaves my possession. See my shop policies for further details. CA buyers, sales tax will be added to your order. Feedback: Once you leave feedback for me I will reciprocate. That’s only fair.",

Contact me for any custom work and we can discuss details, option and limitations. Q: What it the thickest book available? A: I can cut books up to 2” thick. Any thicker and it will not fit under my saw for the cutting process. Q: Can I send you a book to hollow out? A: In most cases yes. Contact me for any custom work and we can discuss details, option and limitations. Q: Can you install magnetic enclosures or a lock? A: At this time, no. For a number of structural, appearance and durability reasons I don’t offer this service. Contact me for details if you would like to know more. ",
