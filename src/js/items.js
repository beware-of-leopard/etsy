Many of the fabrics and clothing sold had stains, rips, missing buttons, or rusted hardware. By turning them into new pieces, an appreciation for the past is translated into practicality and unique fashions for the present and future. Please note, some items for sale may have small stains or holes. Although we will alert you in the listing, we believe that these are not flaws but show the materials have been places! We hope you find a fun gift for yourself, a friend, or a family member.","policy_payment":"We accept payment via direct checkout (credit card), PayPal, money order, or cash (in person). Many items are final except for gross misrepresentation. Please note, a purchase with a money order can take up to three weeks to ship.\r\n\r\nWe are more than happy to reserve items or do layaway, just send us a convo. Items will only be reserved for 5 days before requiring a 20% deposit, otherwise said item will once again be made available for the general population.","policy_shipping":"We ship all items via the cheapest shipping method via USPS First Class, Priority, and Media Mail. We include tracking whenever possible.\r\n\r\nAs of 9\/2015, items are likely to be shipped from Florida but still may be shipped from various boroughs throughout New York City. Our return address will be the same, regardless of the state the package is shipped from.\r\n\r\nWe are not responsible for any customs fees from international buyers.\r\n\r\nShipping and handling overages will be refunded as soon as the item is shipped.\r\n\r\nEverything but the tape in our packaging is recycled or salvaged. Some of the shipping supplies we use include yarn, ribbon, stickers, vintage and modern wrapping paper, plastic shopping bags, and other thrifted materials. Smaller purchases are often shipped in recycled greeting card envelopes.","policy_refunds":"Please contact us if there is an issue with your order. We do NOT offer refunds due to light vintage smells or small holes and stains. By purchasing, it is assumed that you recognize these are used items or made from used materials. Some items will require professional cleaning. If you would like items ready-to-wear out of the box, please contact us upon purchase and we can do this for an additional fee.\r\n\r\nFor items $20 or less: items can be returned for store credit or refund \r\n\r\nFor items $22 or more: items can be returned for store credit only\r\n\r\nFor items $100 or more: NO REFUNDS OR RETURNS except in gross misrepresentation, inaccurate dating (eg marked as 50&#39;s but it&#39;s 90&#39;s), or excessive damage not mentioned in the listing. Depending on the type of return, a store credit or refund will be issued.\r\n\r\n*Items that are not eligible include handmade hair accessories, bathing suits, lingerie, and most custom made orders. Buyer is almost always responsible for return shipping. Please initiate your returns within 7 days of receiving your item.","policy_additional":"Most of the items in our shop were salvaged. This means many items would have been destined for fabric recycling warehouses, often as rags. Items made from vintage and antique fabrics often arrived to us in unwashed condition...usually not even fit enough to sell at thrift stores. We try our best to clean the items and isolate any flaws, but we can only guarantee to have eliminated strong smells, unless noted. Linings for our handmade garments are almost always guaranteed to have stains, however, stained linings will always be made from cool fabrics. Although we will try to mention any issues with items in the listings, please do not expect items to be in &quot;like-new&quot; condition, unless stated. Nothing will be sold with large, obvious stains, rips, tears, and holes without a disclaimer and photos of severe flaws.\r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1446433675,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"Be back later.","url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SunnyPsychedelic?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":null,"num_favorers":195,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/100\/0\/10418083\/isla_fullxfull.16413737_5nelellm.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":271501961,"state":"active","user_id":51722842,"category_id":69151501,"title":"Afro Pick Ankh of Life  Mismatched Earrings  Free Shipping","description":"Gorgeous Afro pick natural hair adorned wombman earrings hand painted black or browns.

How do I print my invitation?\r\n-A. When you order a digital file you have several printing options. \r\n1.\tIf your printer has the capability to print on heavy paper, you can print your custom invitation on your home color printer using cardstock or photo paper. \r\n2.\tYou can take the file on a flash drive or CD-R to a photo lab and print it just like you would a regular picture with as many copies as you need. This excludes my instant download items.\r\n3.\tLocal places such as Kinkos, Staples, and Office Depot also offer a Print To Store option which allows you to order your invitation online. \r\n4.\tYou can place your order through an online photo lab as well and have it shipped, such as Mpix. This excludes my instant download items.\r\n5.\tIf you prefer card stock over JPG, stores like Kinkos and Office Max also offer card stock printing. All of my instant download items can be printed this way and I would strongly advise printing on card stock for these items.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Q. My item is printing differently than what I&#39;m seeing on my screen. Why?\r\n-A. There can be many reasons, but if you are printing from a PDF, please note that your Adobe Reader software must be up to date or it may not print correctly on a home or a commercial printer. A free, up-to-date version can always be found at get.adobe.com\/reader.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n-Q. Can I get a proof of my invitation before I place an order?\r\n-A. Payment is required before any proof is sent. I receive a lot of orders and I only have a specific amount of time to complete them. Orders are worked on in the order of purchase. I will not provide proofs of instant download items.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Q. Can I get my item in a size other than what is specified in the listing?\r\n-A. I can do most items in any size you need at no extra charge unless it is an instant download item. There is an additional fee for size changes for instant download items.\r\n\r\nQ. Can I change the wording, font, colors, etc.?\r\n-A. My invitations are completely customizable so I do allow changes. Simple changes like wording or color can be done free of charge (not applicable for instant download items). I purchase the rights to use certain fonts, so if you have a specific font in mind, I will have to check on its availability before use. Graphics changes will be considered a custom order, which ranges from $5 to $25 per proof. Please contact me for more information.\r\n\r\nAlso, since all wording can be changed, that means that any invitation can be customized for another event type.","policy_payment":"\u2022\tPayment is due upon purchase.
